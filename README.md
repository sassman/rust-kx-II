# Rust KX - II

This session is all about [Unikernels][1] and [rusty-hermit][2].

## Intro

> containers where yesterday, today we'll package our web service as OS and run it directly on a hypervisor

[![arch](https://rust-osdev.com/showcase/rusty-hermit/libos.png)][2]

maybe slides?

## Setup

### 0. Git Submodules!

make sure you have them all updated.

```sh
git submodules init
git submodules update
```

### 0.1 Qemu + deps

We going to use Qemu as hypervisor, let's install it.

> Windows users [might look](https://github.com/hermitcore/rusty-loader/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml#L52) up their dependencies, sorry I have not tested it.

#### Linux

```sh
sudo apt-get update --fix-missing 
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86 nasm
```

#### MacOS

```sh
brew install qemu nasm
```

### 1. Rust nightly

```sh
rustup default nightly
cargo install cargo-download
rustup component add rust-src llvm-tools-preview
```

### 2. Build the loader

```sh
cd rusty-loader
release=1 make
```

### Linux

### MacOS

## Demo

### Hello World

```sh
cd hello-hermit
cargo run --release
```

What we should get is something like this:

```plain
[LOADER] Loader: [0x100000 - 0x31a018]
[LOADER] Found Multiboot information at 0x9500
[LOADER] Found module: [0x31c000 - 0x5113d0]
[LOADER] Module length: 0x1f53d0
[LOADER] Found an ELF module at 0x31c000

```

ðŸš€ Congrats! The first application as OS has been launched

> NOTE: the demo project has a `.cargo/config` file that describes the target architecture, features and the runner, that is `qemu` in this case

### Echo TCP Server

> NOTE: Don't run with `--release` this seems to panic!
